敝姓杜卡 我是忍者大师的代言人
My name is merely Ducard, but l speak for Ra's al Ghul...

他是犯罪集团的克星
...a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.

35
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,684
他可以指引你一条明路
A man who can offer you a path.

36
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,086
你凭什么认为我需要指引?

忍者大师能指引我走哪条路?
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

也就是影武者联盟之路

为一个崇高理想全心投入
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

50
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,339
他们就无法阻止你
...and if they can't stop you...

51
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,185
你也将成为另一种人
...then you become something else entirely.

52
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,412
什么人?
Which is?

53
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:25,893

摘下一朵蓝花
Pick one of these flowers.

58
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:41,041
如果你能把它带到山巅

也许就能找到你当初在寻找的东西

00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,683
只有你自己知道
Only you can know that.

62
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:01,447
回去 你一定要回头
You turn back. You go back.

63
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,084
忍者大师?
Ra's al Ghul?

64
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:22,860
且慢
Wait.

65
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,170
你在寻找什么?
What are you seeking?

00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:30,100
我在寻找...
l seek...

67

打击犯罪、伸张正义的方法
...the means to fight injustice.

68
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,374
让制造恐惧的恶徒...
To turn fear...

69
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,583
心生恐惧
...against those who prey on the fearful.

70
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:04,335
你要让别人心生恐惧
To manipulate the fears in others...

71
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:08,615
就必须先战胜自己内心的恐惧
...you must first master your own.

72
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,947
你准备开战了吗?
Are you ready to begin?

73
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,412
我连站都站不起来
l can.... l can barely stand.

74
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,954
死神不会等你准备好
Death does not wait for you to be ready!

75
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:20,252
死神绝不手下留情!
Death is not considerate or fair!

76
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:25,390
你面对死神吧 不容有失
And make no mistake, here you face death.

00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,147
而且你仍然害怕

00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,958
但不是怕我
But not of me.

83
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,923
告诉我 韦恩先生
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

84
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,602

老爷 我要叫救护车吗?
Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne?

89
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,721
我先替他接骨 待会再照X光

90
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,127

-l'm very sorry, sir. l've told... -Don't worry. lt's fine.

92
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,575
你跌得很惨 对吧 少爷?
Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?

93
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,039
我们为什么跌倒 布鲁斯?
And why do we fall, Bruce?

94
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:46,438
这样才能学会站起来
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:53,084
只是小跌了一下 轻微骨折而已
Just a little fall. lt's just a small fracture.

96
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,859
你又想到那些蝙蝠?
The bats again?

97
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,160
你知道他们为什么攻击你吗?
You know why they attacked you, don't you?

98
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,729
- 因为他们怕你 - 他们怕我?
-They were afraid of you. -Afraid of me?

99
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,874
每种生物都有恐惧
All creatures feel fear.

100
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,406

Even the scary ones?

尤其是可怕的怪物
Especially the scary ones.

106
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,189
爸 高架铁路是你盖的吗?
Did you build this train, Dad?

107
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:43,064
高谭市对韦恩家族很好 但这城市日渐没落
Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering.

108
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:46,764
小老百姓的日子过得很辛苦
People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.

109
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,876
于是我们建造经济的大众交通工具 把全体市民连结在一起
So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city.

110
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,740

歌剧听久了很累人 对吧?
A little bit of opera goes a long way. Right, Bruce?

122
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,040
我们回家吧

00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,381
我也是 布鲁斯少爷
So do l, Master Bruce.

157
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,046
我也是
So do l.

158
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,157
你还是认为是你害死你父母的吗?
And do you still feel responsible for your parents' death?

159
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,451
我的愤怒比罪恶感更多
My anger outweighs my guilt.

160
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,593
来吧
Come.

161
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,962
你学会了用愤怒代替罪恶感
You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.

162
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:19,162
我会教你接受它并面对事实
l will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.

163
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:26,635
你可以一个人对付六个人 我要教你一个人对付六百人
You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

164
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:32,113
你知道怎么把自己藏起来 我可以教你怎么隐形
You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible.

165
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,482
隐形?
lnvisible?

166
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,210
小卫

167
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:44,123
忍者的隐形术全是靠耐心 和矫捷的身手
The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.

168
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,806
耳听四面、眼观八方
Always mind your surroundings.

169
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,177
忍者会运用火药
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

170
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,915
- 做为武器? - 或是障眼法
-As weapons? -Or distractions.

171
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,420
戏剧效果和障眼法很有效
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.

172
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:13,917
你不能让敌人把你当成凡人
You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.

173
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,356
- 他是谁? - 一个农夫
-Who is he? -He was a farmer.

174
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:21,763
他为了抢邻居的农地杀人
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land and became a murderer.

175
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,233
- 现在变成一名囚犯 - 他会有什么下场?
-Now he is a prisoner. -What'll happen to him?

176
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,838
杀人就要偿命 不能姑息养奸
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

177
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:30,943
社会漠不关心才会让治安败坏
Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding.

178
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,814
你父母的死不是你的错
Your parents' death was not your fault.

179
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,421
是你父亲的错
lt was your father's.

180
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,148
你不能改变他不敢反击的事实
Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.

181
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,513
- 对方的手上有枪 - 那能阻止你吗?
-The man had a gun. -Would that stop you?

182
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,549
我接受过武术训练
l've had training.

183
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,553
那不是重点
The training is nothing!

184
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,385
决心才重要
Will is everything!

185
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,996
主动出击的决心
The will to act.

186
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,005
投降吧
Yield.

187
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,710
你并没有打败我
You haven't beaten me.

188
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,610
你为了杀敌失去重心
You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke.

189
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,020
用力磨擦胸口
Rub your chest.

190
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:55,393
你的手可以帮你取暖
Your arms will take care of themselves.

191
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,690
你比你父亲更坚强
You are stronger than your father.

192
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,994
你不了解我父亲
You didn't know my father.

193
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,467
我了解你内心的愤怒
But l know the rage that drives you.

194
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:09,666
你的愤怒让你暂时忘却伤痛 直到你无法承受
That impossible anger strangling the grief, until the memory of your loved one is just...

195
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:11,902
对亲人的思念
...poison in your veins.

196
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:16,537
有一天你会希望他们不存在
And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed...

197
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,418
好让你的痛苦消失
...so you'd be spared your pain.

198
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,823
我并不是一直都住在山上
l wasn't always here in the mountains.

199
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,487
我也有过一个妻子
Once, l had a wife.

200
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,365
我一生的最爱
My great love.

201
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,661
她惨遭杀害
She was taken from me.

202
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:40,034
我和你一样学会不能纵容坏人
Like you, l was forced to learn there are those without decency...

203
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:43,506
对他们绝对不能手下留情
...who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.

204
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,644
愤怒给了你很大的力量
Your anger gives you great power.

205
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,675
但若不学会控制 它会毁了你
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

206
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:53,447
愤怒差点毁了我一生
...as it almost did me.

207
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,111
- 你是如何平息怒气? - 报仇
-What stopped it? -Vengeance.

208
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,124
这对我没有用
That's no help to me.

209
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,157
为什么?
Why, Bruce?

210
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,990
你为什么不为父母报仇?
Why could you not avenge your parents?

211
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:11,259
听证会后你要回普林斯顿大学
Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir...

212
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,100
还是你愿意多留一、两天?
...or can l persuade you to stay on for a day or two?

213
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,504
我不要回去
l'm not heading back at all.

214
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,700
- 你不喜欢那里? - 我很喜欢
-You don't like it there? -l like it fine.

215
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,910
只是校方不喜欢我
They just don't feel the same way.

216
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:26,379
- 我安排你睡在主卧室 - 不用
-l've prepared the master bedroom. -No.

217
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:27,952
我睡我的房间就行
My room will be fine.

218
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,646
恕我直言 韦恩宅邸是你的
With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.

219
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,689
不 这是我父亲的
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

220
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,225
- 你父亲过世了 少爷 - 这地方是他的陵墓
-Your father is dead. -This place is a mausoleum.

221
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,421
我宁愿把它的一砖一瓦拆掉
lf l have my way, l'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick.

222
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:42,694
这是韦恩家族世代相传的宅邸
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family.

223
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,565
你干嘛在乎? 这又不是你家
Why do you give a damn, Alfred? lt's not your family.

224
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:50,274
我之所以在乎是因为一位好人...
l give a damn because a good man once made me responsible...

225
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:53,105
把他心爱的独子
...for what was most precious to him...

226
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,510
托付给我
...in the whole world.

227
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:01,011
道斯小姐要载你到法院
Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.

228
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,246
她大概想劝你不要去
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.

229
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:06,859
我应该把过去也埋在地下吗?
Should l just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?

230
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:10,121
我不能告诉你该如何面对过去
l wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.

231
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:14,324
但是有很多人关心你的未来
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

232
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,226
你还没放弃我 是吗?
Haven't given up on me yet?

233
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,394
永远都不会
Never.

234
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:11,355
阿尔弗雷德一向都把炼奶放在最上面
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.

235
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:15,985
- 他不知道你已长高、拿得到了吗? - 我猜那是老习惯吧
- Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now? - Old habits die hard, l guess.

236
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:18,556
- 我们小时候一样有办法拿到 - 没错
-Never used to stop us anyway. -No, it didn't.

237
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,632
你母亲好吗?
How's your mom?

238
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:23,264
她很怀念这地方
She misses this place.

239
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,295
我也一样
So do l.

240
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,933
是啊
Yeah.

241
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:31,100
只可惜现在已经人事全非了
But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was.

242
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,303
- 只有阿尔弗雷德还在这里 - 还有你呀
-Now there's only Alfred. -And you.

243
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:38,008
- 我不会留下来 瑞秋 - 你只是回来参加听证会
-l'm not staying, Rachel. -You're just back for the hearing.

244
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:45,819
我知道谁也无法阻止你去
Bruce, l don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come.

245
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:49,618
这场听证会总得有人...
Someone at this proceeding...

246
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,457
代表我父母出席
...should stand for my parents.

247
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,759
我们都很爱你的父母
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

248
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,165
- 凶手齐利的行为不可原谅 - 但是你的上司却要让他出狱
-What Chill did is unforgivable. -Then why is your boss letting him go?

249
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,770
他和卡曼费康尼是牢友
ln prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone.

250
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,605
他愿意出庭作证交换提前假释
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole.

251
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,442
瑞秋 他杀死我父母
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

252
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,180
我不能忘记这件事
l cannot let that pass.

253
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:16,220
我希望你能了解我的心情
And l need you to understand that, please.

254
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,185
好吧
Okay.

255
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,593
经济大萧条害齐利先生走投无路
The depression hit working people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

256
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:28,962
虽然他的罪行令人发指 但他是走投无路才铤而走险
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed, but by desperation.

257
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,070
他已服刑14年 并将协助我们
Given the 1 4 years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:35,769
侦办地检署最重大的案件
...with one of this office's most important investigations...

259
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:39,140
因此我们要求让他假释出狱
...we strongly endorse his petition for early release.

260
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,444
齐利先生?
Mr. Chill?

261
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,678
法官大人
Your Honor...

262
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,716
我每天都为我做的事深感悔恨
...not a day goes by that l don't wish l could take back what l did.

263
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,591
我当时的确是走投无路
Sure, l was desperate, like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:00,096
但这不能改变我的所作所为
...but that don't change what l did.

265
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:08,401
今天有一位韦恩家族成员在场
l gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:10,839
他有话要说吗?
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:28,425
- 他从侧门出来了 - 他从侧门出来了 各位!
-He's coming out the side! -He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,610
- 他来了 - 他来了

269
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:39,401
布鲁斯韦恩
Bruce Wayne!

270
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,436
乔 乔!
Joe! Hey, Joe!

271
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,077
费康尼老大向你问好
Falcone says hi.

272
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,013
走吧 布鲁斯
Come on, Bruce.

273
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,016
我们不必看到这一幕
We don't need to see this.

274
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,317
我要看
l do.

275
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:10,459
法官坚持要举行公开听证会
The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden insisted on making the hearing public.

276
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:13,037
他一定是被费康尼老大收买了 让齐利公开露面
Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.

277
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,501
也许我应该感谢他们才对
Maybe l should thank them.

278
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,233
- 你不是说真的 - 也许我是说真的 瑞秋
-You don't mean that. -What if l do, Rachel?

279
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,343
是该为我父母伸张正义
My parents deserved justice.

280
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:22,413
这不是伸张正义而是报仇雪恨
You're not talking about justice. You're talking about revenge.

281
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,483
- 有时候这两者是一样的 - 不 绝对不一样
-Sometimes, they're the same. -No, they're never the same.

282
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:29,213
伸张正义是为了维持社会和谐 报仇只是为了逞一时之快
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

283
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:32,688
- 所以才会有公正的司法制度 - 司法制度早已名存实亡
-Which is why we have an impartial system. -Your system is broken.

284
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,599
你想伸张正义就要忘却伤痛
You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

285
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,503
这个城市已经沉沦腐败
This city is rotting.

286
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,435
他们说经济大萧条已成历史 才怪
They talk about the depression as if it's history. lt's not.

287
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,097
老百姓的日子越来越苦
Things are worse than ever here.

288
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,835
黑帮老大费康尼趁火打劫、无恶不作
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs...

289
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,946
逼人走上不归路 满街都是齐利之辈
...preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day.

290
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,639
他也许没有亲手杀死你父母
Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce...

291
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,775
却毁了他们代表的一切
...but he's destroying everything that they stood for.

292
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:08,226
你想感谢他就去吧
You wanna thank him for that? Here you go.

293
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,461
大家都知道他在哪里
We all know where to find him.

294
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,998
但是只要他继续为非作歹 就没有人动得了他
As long as he keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared, no one'll touch him.

295
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:19,599
你父母这种仗义执言的好人 找不到了
Good people like your parents, who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.

296
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:22,673
没人挺身而出 高谭市就完了
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?

297
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:28,047
- 我不是你说的好人 - 什么意思?
-l'm not one of your good people, Rachel. -What do you mean?

298
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:35,782
这些年来我一直想杀他 现在没机会了
All these years, l wanted to kill him. Now l can't.

299
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,265
你父亲会以你为耻
Your father would be ashamed of you.

300
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:39,274
你本人看来比报上的照片高大
You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

301
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,583
你没带枪? 真瞧不起人
No gun? l'm insulted.

302
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:48,625
- 你大可以寄张感谢卡给我就好 - 我不是来感谢你的
-You could've just sent a thank-you note. -l didn't come here to thank you.

303
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:51,491
我要告诉你并不是人人都怕你
l came to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

304
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,291
认识我的人才怕我
Only those who know me, kid.

305
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,101
你自己看 这里有两位市议员
Look around you. You'll see two councilmen...

306
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:59,269
一位工会代表 两名警察
...a union official, couple off-duty cops...

307
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:01,333
和一位法官
...and a judge.

308
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:05,773
我大可以在他们面前毙了你
Now, l wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them.

309
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,675
这种权力是买不到的
Now, that's power you can't buy.

310
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,748
这就是恐惧的力量
That's the power of fear.

311
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,412
我并不怕你
l'm not afraid of you.

312
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,485
你自以为能完全豁出去
Because you think you got nothing to lose.

313
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:16,281
但是你没有想清楚
But you haven't thought it through.

314
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:19,584
你没想到在地检署工作 青梅竹马的女朋友
You haven't thought about your lady friend in the DA's office.

315
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,193
还有对你忠心耿耿的老管家
You haven't thought about your old butler.

316
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:28,664
像你这种人
People from your world...

317
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:31,201
有太多牵挂了
...have so much to lose.

318
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:35,705
你以为你爹娘被人一枪打死
Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot...

319
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,844
就能了解人性的丑陋吗?
...you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't.

320
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,104
你根本就不知道民间疾苦
You've never tasted desperate.

321
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,840
你是高谭市的天之骄子
You're.... You're Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham.

322
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:47,417
你的大名无人不知、无人不晓
You'd have to go 1 000 miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.

323
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:51,887
别正气凛然地跑来当一个大英雄
So don't come down here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself.

324
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,150
你完全不了解犯罪世界
This is a world you'll never understand.

325
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,351
你不了解的事
And you always fear...

326
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,963
永远会让你害怕
...what you don't understand.

327
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:03,233
动手吧
All right.

328
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,710
我倒是很佩服你的胆识
Yeah, you got spirit, kid. l'll give you that.

329
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,848
你比你老子更带种
More than your old man anyway.

330
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:20,315
齐利在牢里跟我提到你父母
ln the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents.

331
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,716
他说你老爸向他...
He said your father begged for mercy.

332
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,819
跪地求饶
Begged.

333
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,390
像条狗一样哀号
Like a dog.

334
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,002
你一定是小费给太少了
Should've tipped better.

335
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,848
- 你要什么? - 你的外套
-For what? -Your jacket.

336
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,012
好吧
Okay.

337
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,581
给我吧 这件大衣不错
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it. lt's a nice coat.

338
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,853
别被人看到你穿这件大衣
Be careful who sees you with that.

339
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:05,363
- 他们会来找我 - 谁?
-They're gonna come looking for me. -Who?

340
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,527
每个人
Everyone.

341
00:31:09,836 --> 00:31:11,599
这件...
lt's....

342
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:13,739
这件大衣真不错
lt's a nice coat.

343
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:36,426
当你和坏人同流合污 会同情他们吗?
When you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them?

344
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:40,293
会的 当我第一次为了吃饭偷东西时
The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

345
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,961
我突然失去了是非善恶的观念
I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong.

346
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,333
当我到处闯荡
And when I traveled...

347
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,205
我尝到犯罪前的恐惧
...I learned the fear before a crime...

348
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:55,539
以及得手后的兴奋
...and the thrill of success.

349
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,281
但是我从来没变成坏人
But I never became one of them.

350
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,680
他不想说他的名字

351
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,690
我管你叫什么 你只是个犯人
Fool. What do l care what your name is? You're a criminal.

352
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:06,914
我不是犯人
I'm not a criminal

353
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,924
你去和这批货的主人说吧
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

354
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,580
(韦恩企业 中国制造)

355
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:16,090
你为了克服内心恐惧 并洞悉犯罪心理而走遍全世界
You've traveled the world to understand the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

356
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:22,300
但是罪犯的内心并不复杂
But a criminal is not complicated.

357
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:25,808
你真正害怕的是自己的内心
And what you really fear is inside yourself.

358
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:28,538
你害怕你自己的力量
You fear your own power.

359
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:29,976
你也害怕你内心的愤怒...
You fear your anger...

360
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,715
会逼你做出伟大或可怕的事
...the drive to do great or terrible things.

361
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:38,323
你必须克服你的内心恐惧
Now you must journey inwards.

362
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,187
准备好了
You are ready.

363
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,597
吸气
Breathe.

364
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,042
用力吸气
Breathe.

365
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,880
把你的恐惧吸进去
Breathe in your fears.

366
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,509
面对你的恐惧
Face them.

367
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,820
你要成为恐惧本身 才能克服它
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

368
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,393
你必须造成别人的恐惧
You must bask in the fear of other men.

369
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,266
而大家都害怕看不见的东西
And men fear most what they cannot see.

370
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:41,351
你必须让人想到你就害怕
You have to become a terrible thought.

371
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:47,119
成为死神化身
A wraith.

372
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:55,198
让坏人闻风丧胆
You have to become an idea!

373
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:05,134
感受恐惧如何模糊你的感官
Feel terror cloud your senses.

374
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:10,076
让恐惧的力量扭曲你的身心
Feel its power to distort.

375
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,280
掌控你的一切
To control.

376
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:20,155
这股恐惧的力量才会属于你
And know that this power can be yours.

377
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:35,367
拥抱你最深层的恐惧
Embrace your worst fear.

378
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,645
和恐惧的黑暗力量融为一体
Become one with the darkness.

379
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,198
全神贯注
Focus.

380
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,666
全心投入
Concentrate.

381
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:10,934
随心所欲控制你的全身
Master your senses.

382
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:41,472
你不能露出你的行踪
You cannot leave any sign.

383
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:43,069
我并没有
l haven't.

384
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,341
很好
lmpressive.

385
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,557
我们已经消除你的恐惧
We have purged your fear.

386
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:07,325
你可以当这批勇士的首领
You are ready to lead these men.

387
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,027
你可以加入影武者联盟
You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.

388
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,836
但首先要证明你矢志维护正义
But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.

389
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:35,958
不
No.

390
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,690
我不是刽子手
l'm no executioner.

391
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:42,928
敌人不会对你手下留情
Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.

392
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,566
这才是重点
That's why it's so important.

393
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:47,567
这就是我们和他们的不同
lt separates us from them.

394
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,140
你想打击犯罪 他就是杀人犯
You want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer.

395
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,106
- 他应该接受审判 - 受谁审判?
-This man should be tried. -By whom?

396
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:53,973
让贪污腐败的法官来审判?
Corrupt bureaucrats?

397
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,637
坏人根本没把法律放在眼里
Criminals mock society's laws.

398
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:59,114
你比任何人都清楚这一点
You know this better than most.

399
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:02,579
你不能率领他们
You cannot lead these men...

400
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:06,748
除非你能不择手段打击犯罪
...unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.

401
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,793
我要率领他们到哪里?
And where would l be leading these men?

402
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,591
高谭市
Gotham.

403
00:37:11,764 --> 00:37:13,823
你是高谭市的天之骄子
As Gotham's favored son...

404
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:18,333
你有能力瓦解高谭市的恶势力
...you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.

405
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:22,470
- 我该怎么做? - 高谭市的气数已尽
-How? -Gotham's time has come.

406
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,974
就跟君士坦丁堡和古罗马一样
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

407
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:30,343
高谭市已经沦为万恶的城市
...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.

408
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:34,111
它无可救药 必须将它毁灭
lt is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

409
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:39,485
这是影武者联盟最重要的任务
This is the most important function of the League of Shadows.

410
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,851
也是我们数百年来的使命
lt is one we've performed for centuries.

411
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,924
高谭市...
Gotham...

412
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,998
一定要被摧毁
...must be destroyed.

413
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:52,827
你不会信这种鬼话吧?
You can't believe in this.

414
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:57,565
忍者大师将我们从 内心最黑暗的角落拯救出来
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts.

415
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:02,146
他要求我们以勇气 行当行之事回报他
What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary.

416
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:05,714
我会回高谭市对付这类坏人
l will go back to Gotham and l will fight men like this...

417
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:08,445
但是我不会当刽子手
...but l will not become an executioner.

418
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,179
布鲁斯 别这样
Bruce, please.

419
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:13,189
你要想清楚 你已不能回头
For your own sake, there is no turning back.

420
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:48,084
- 你是在干什么? - 行我当行之事
-What are you doing? -What's necessary, my friend.

421
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,624
我会跟他说你救他一命
l will tell him you saved his life.

422
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:28,910
韦恩少爷 你消失好一阵子
Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.

423
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,352
- 是啊 - 你这身打扮很时髦
-Yes, l have. -You look very fashionable.

424
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,358
只是有点脏
Apart from the mud.

425
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:37,288
你这次会待很久吗?
Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?

426
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:38,691
需要待多久就待多久
As long as it takes.

427
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:40,354
我要让高谭市市民知道
l want to show the people...

428
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:43,968
这城市不属于贪官与罪犯
...their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.

429
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:47,333
经济大萧条期间你爸为了消弭贫穷
ln the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

430
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,734
几乎倾家荡产
...combating poverty.

431
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:53,435
他相信他能让有钱人共襄盛举 拯救高谭市
He believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

432
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,337
他成功了吗?
Did it?

433
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:57,949
算是吧
ln a way.

434
00:41:58,117 --> 00:42:01,177
他惨遭谋杀 为有钱有势的人敲响警钟
Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.

435
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,248
人们的漠不关心 唯有戏剧性大逆转才能唤醒
People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.

436
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:08,086
身为布鲁斯韦恩做不了什么
l can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

437
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,784
我只是个血肉之躯
As a man...

438
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:12,362
很容易被忽视、摧毁
...l'm flesh and blood, l can be ignored, destroyed.

439
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,465
但是成为正义化身
But as a symbol....

440
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,562
我就永远不会被击败
As a symbol, l can be incorruptible.

441
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,364
- 永远正气长存 - 什么化身?
-l can be everlasting. -What symbol?

442
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:24,636
一种原始的...
Something elemental...

443
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,437
可怕的化身
...something terrifying.

444
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,705
你单枪匹马对抗犯罪集团
l assume that as you take on the underworld...

445
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:34,012
我以为这化身是会 保护你关心的人不被报复
...this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals?

446
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:35,551
你说的是瑞秋吗?
You're thinking about Rachel?

447
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,087
其实我说的是我自己
Actually, sir, l was thinking of myself.

448
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,854
有人知道我回来吗?
Have you told anyone l'm coming back?

449
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,258
我不敢让人知道你死而复生
l couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.

450
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,331
- 死而复生? - 你失踪了七年
-Dead? -You've been gone seven years.

451
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,762
你对外宣布我死了?
You had me declared dead?

452
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,836
其实是厄尔先生 他要让公司上市
Actually, it was Mr. Earle. He's taking the company public.

453
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:55,269
他也要把你的股票卖掉
He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.

454
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,772
那些股票值很多钱
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.

455
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:00,673
幸好我把全部财产都留给你
Well, it's a good thing l left everything to you, then.

456
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:02,942
是的 少爷
Quite so, sir.

457
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:06,744
我的劳斯莱斯可以借你开 回来时别忘了加满油
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank.

458
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:21,528
我认为萨兹先生会试图自杀并危害他人
ln my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others...

459
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,462
因此监狱并不适合他
...and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.

460
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:31,368
- 克莱恩医师 - 道斯小姐
-Dr. Crane. -Miss Dawes.

461
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,808
你真的认为黑道杀手不该坐牢?
You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

462
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,642
我若不这么认为 就不会替他辩护
l would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would l?

463
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:40,910
费康尼老大有三个杀手
This is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane...

464
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,484
被你送进精神疗养院
...and moved into your asylum.

465
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,350
混黑道一定很容易被逼疯
Well, the work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.

466
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:50,885
或是被收买
Or the corrupt.

467
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,723
芬奇先生
Mr. Finch.

468
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:56,864
你最好劝劝道斯小姐
You should check with Miss Dawes here...

469
00:43:57,035 --> 00:44:01,404
不要无凭无据对我提出指控
...just what implications your office has authorized her to make. lf any.

470
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,708
- 瑞秋 你这是在做什么? - 你又是在做什么 卡尔?
-What are you doing? -What are you doing, Carl?

471
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,244
我是在保护你
Looking out for you.

472
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,650
费康尼收买了一半的政府官员
Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.

473
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,879
- 放弃吧 - 你怎么能这么说?
-Drop it. -How can you say that?

474
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:20,752
我痛恨费康尼 但我更关心你
Because as much as l care about getting Falcone, l care more about you.

475
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:22,223
我知道你对我好
That's sweet.

476
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:29,999
但我不能接受
We've been through all that.

477
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:57,527
又有一只蝙蝠飞进来
Blessed bat again, sir.

478
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,396
他们的巢穴一定在地底
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

479
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:00,979
我不帮你了 有人对我起疑心
No more favors. Someone is sniffing around.

480
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:04,122
我帮你 你帮我
Hey, l scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc.

481
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:05,654
我替你们把货运进来
l'm bringing in the shipments.

482
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:07,585
我们有付你钱
We are paying you for that.

483
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:10,250
付钱并不算是帮我的忙
Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors.

484
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:17,565
我知道你并不怕我 费康尼先生
l am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

485
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,795
但是等我的老板来了以后...
But you know who l'm working for, and when he gets here...

486
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,906
他要来高谭市?
He... He's coming to Gotham?

487
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:24,507
是的
Yes, he is.

488
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:27,144
他来了以后会想听到...
And when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear...

489
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:32,409
你为了几个小混混危害我们的行动
...that you have endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.

490
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,751
- 谁在找你麻烦? - 地检署的一个女孩
-Who's bothering you? -There's a girl at the DA's office.

491
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:39,019
- 我们用钱收买她 - 她不要钱
-We'll buy her off. -Not this one.

492
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,058
原来是理想主义者
ldealist, huh?

493
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:43,956
我也有办法对付这种人
Well, there's an answer to that too.

494
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:47,298
- 我并不想知道 - 你非知道不可
-l don't want to know. -Yes, you do.

495
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:51,290
(韦恩大楼)

496
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,906
其它部门的业绩有稳健的成长
No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.

497
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:58,270
汤犸斯韦恩绝对不会同意...
l don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

498
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:00,570
让公司变成军火制造商
...as a suitable cornerstone for our business.

499
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,780
那是二十年前的事 佛德瑞
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

500
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:09,247
汤犸斯韦恩都死了二十年
l think after 20 years we can allow ourselves...

501
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,287
我们不必再管他怎么想
...to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.

502

早安 厄尔先生办公室

汤犸斯也许不会让公司上市

508
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:34,739
但我们为了公司一定要这么做
But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do.

00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:54,262
老詹 你不收贿让大家很紧张
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste, makes us guys nervous.

589
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:56,297
我不会告密
l'm no rat.

590
00:53:59,037 --> 00:54:02,734
大家都被收买 我能向谁告状?
ln a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway?

591
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,564
别转身
Don't turn around.

592
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:38,232
你是硕果仅存的好警察
You're a good cop. One of the few.

593
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,036
你要干什么?
What do you want?

594
00:54:40,211 --> 00:54:43,374
费康尼每星期都进一批毒品
Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week.

595
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:45,345
为什么没人阻止他?
Nobody takes him down. Why?

596
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:48,878
他收买了警察和法官
He's paid up with the right people.

597
00:54:49,187 --> 00:54:51,951
该怎么做才能制止他?
What will it take to bring him down?

598
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,090
向斐登法官施压
Leverage on Judge Faden...

599
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,192
找一个有胆识的检察官
...and a DA brave enough to prosecute.

600
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:00,223
瑞秋道斯

你是谁?
Who are you?

602
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,960
注意我的信号
Watch for my sign.

603
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:08,663
你只有一个人?
You're just one man?

604
00:55:09,107 --> 00:55:10,540
现在我们有两个人
Now we're two.

605
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:14,236
我们?
We?

606
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:31,623
站住!
Freeze!

607
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:50,747
那是什么人?
What the hell was that?

608
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:54,879
只是一个疯子
Just some nut.

609
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:01,087
今天你又要去洞穴探险吗?
Well, what is it today? More spelunking?

610
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:03,727
不 今天我要定点跳伞
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

611
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:05,956
定点跳伞?
BASE-jumping.

612
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:09,091
- 像是高空跳伞吗? - 差不多
-That like parachuting? -Kind of.

613
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:13,099
你有轻质布料吗?
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

614
00:56:13,271 --> 00:56:15,933
我正好有你要的布料
You know, l think l have just the thing.

615
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:19,709
这叫记忆布料 看到吗?
lt's called memory cloth. Notice anything?

616
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,947
和一般布料一样轻柔
Regularly flexible...

617
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:27,477
但是一旦通上电流
...but put a current through it...

618
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:32,616
- 分子重新组合后就会变硬 - 你可以做成什么形状? ?
-...molecules realign, it becomes rigid. -What kind of shapes can you make?

619
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:35,918
只要有骨架 什么形状都行
Can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton.

620
00:56:36,094 --> 00:56:37,322
军方又嫌太贵吗?
Too expensive for the Army?

621
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:42,228
他们没想到亿万富翁会有兴趣 去洞穴探险或定点跳伞
l don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd.

622
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,197
- 福克斯先生 - 是的
-Look, Mr. Fox. -Yes, sir?

623
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,234
如果你觉得不妥...
lf you're uncomfortable...

624
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:49,601
只要你不跟我实话实说
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing...

625
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:51,742
我被问到就不必说谎
...when l'm asked, l don't have to lie.

626
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:56,105
不过别以为我是傻子
But don't think of me as an idiot.

627
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:59,583
好吧
Fair enough.

628
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,316
那是什么?
What's that?

629
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:07,324
那辆弹力车?
The Tumbler?

630
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,793
你不会有兴趣的
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

631
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,734
这是造桥用的越野车
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

632
00:57:19,704 --> 00:57:24,141
作战时可以拉着缆绳跳过河流
During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables.

633
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:30,306
只要让推进器全速前进
Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up.

634
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,040
它就能越过任何障碍 不要乱来!
This will boost you into a rampless jump... Not now!

635
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:38,014
小子 别乱来
Not... Not now, sir.

636
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,725
关闭再燃装置
Afterburner disengaged.

637
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:46,120
我们一直没办法造桥
We never could get the damn bridge to work...

638
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:48,026
不过这辆车性能超强
...but this baby works just fine.

639
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:58,803
你觉得怎样?
So, what do you think?

640
00:58:00,078 --> 00:58:02,069
有黑色车款吗?
Does it come in black?

641
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:05,079
我要你星期四到码头
I need you at the docks Thursday.

642
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:07,216
- 有麻烦吗? - 最后一批货...
-Problems? -l don't want any trouble...

643
00:58:07,385 --> 00:58:09,478
- 不能出错 - 好吧
-...with the last shipment. -Sure.

644
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:14,752
听说有一位检察官在找你麻烦
Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.

645
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:17,326
- 是吗? - 听说你肯付...
-ls that right? -And that there's a fat prize...

646
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:20,191
一大笔钱把她除掉
...waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

647
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:22,332
你想说什么 佛莱斯警官?
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

648
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,027
你看过那女孩吗?
Have you seen the girl?

649
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:27,231
她是个美女助理检察官
It's a cute little assistant DA.

650
00:58:27,405 --> 00:58:31,068
拿她开刀不太好吧?
Don't you think that's a little bit too much heat to bring down, maybe?

651
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:34,541
- 你会激起众怒 - 别太高估高谭市的治安
-Even for this town. -Never underestimate Gotham City.

652
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,545
每天都有人下班被抢
People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.

653
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:40,343
有时候就是会莫名其妙走霉运
Sometimes... Sometimes things just go bad.

654
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:46,019
这批货的石墨含量太高
lt's a problem with the graphite, sir.

655
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:48,920
下一批货一定没问题
The next 1 0,000 will be up to specifications.

656
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,652
- 至少厂商给我们打了折 - 是啊
-At least they gave us a discount. -Quite.

657
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:57,461
我建议你最好暂时不要撞到头
ln the meantime, sir, may l suggest you try to avoid landing on your head?

658
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:36,497
你为什么选择蝙蝠?
Why bats, Master Wayne?

659
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:38,003
蝙蝠让我感到恐惧
Bats frighten me.

660
00:59:39,277 --> 00:59:41,575
我也要让敌人一样畏惧我
lt's time my enemies shared my dread.

661
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,206
这是干嘛?
What is this?

662
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:15,308
继续干活吧
Continue.

663
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,512
看起来没问题
Looks fine out there.

664
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,820
玩具熊直接交给毒贩吗?
The bears go straight to the dealers.

665
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,651
对 玩具兔要运到奈何岛
Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows.

666
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:30,851
- 这两种毒品有什么不同? - 你最好不要知道
-What's the difference? -lgnorance is bliss, my friend.

667
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:34,191
你惹不起那些大魔头
Don't burden yourself with the secrets of scary people.

668
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,016
小史?
Hey. Steiss.

669
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,805
小史?
Steiss?

670
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:29,344
干嘛?
What?

671
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:31,588
搞什么?
What the...?

672
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:42,429
我最好去看看
l better check it.

673
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:56,970
大事不妙 你最好闪人
There's a problem out here. You better bail.

674
01:02:26,277 --> 01:02:27,904
你在哪里?
Where are you?!

675
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,137
这里
Here.

676
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:53,500
快开车 哦 要命!
Get going. Oh, shit.

677
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:13,782
你是什么东西?
What the hell are you?

别过来
Hold it.

682
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,454
给我滚远一点
That's right, you better run.

683
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,262
费康尼派他们来杀你
Falcone sent them to kill you.

684
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,961
- 为什么? - 你把他惹毛了
-Why? -You rattled his cage.

685
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,298
- 这是什么? - 你的筹码
-What's this? -Leverage.

686
01:04:38,476 --> 01:04:40,068
- 用来做什么? - 把坏人绳之以法
-For what? -To get things moving.

687
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,368
你是谁?
Who are you?

688
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:44,007
像你一样
Someone like you.

689

想要伸张正义的人
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

690
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:54,814
小姐 你没事吧?
Ma'am? Everything okay?

01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:01,620
- 他们是费康尼的手下? - 逮到他们也没用
-Falcone's men? -Does it matter?

692
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:04,062
费康尼一样有办法脱身
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

693
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:06,394
这次他脱不了身
l wouldn't be too sure of that.

694
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:21,280
这是怎么回事?
What the hell is that?

695
01:05:30,895 --> 01:05:32,157
把他放下来
Cut him down.

696
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,570
(蝙蝠侠逮到黑帮老大)

697
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:55,979
这不可原谅
Unacceptable.

698
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:58,986
我不管他是帮派死对头、守护天使
Now, l don't care if it's rival gangs, Guardian Angels...

699
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:01,124
或是什么救世主
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

700
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,723
把他抓起来 别让他出风头
...get them off the street and off the front page.

701
01:06:03,894 --> 01:06:06,454
听说他是一个人 或是一个怪物
They say it was just one guy. Or a creature.

702
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,326
他只是奇装异服的怪胎
lt was some asshole in a costume.

703
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,528
- 干嘛? - 他抓到...
-Yeah? -This guy did deliver us...

704
01:06:11,702 --> 01:06:14,466
势力最大的黑帮老大
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

705
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:18,130
没人能在我的辖区动私刑
No one takes the law into their own hands in my city.

706
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:19,503
明白吗?
Understand?

707
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,278
- 他这次难逃法律制裁 - 斐登法官会罩他
-No way to bury it now. -There's still Judge Faden.

708
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:25,643
- 我能对付斐登法官 - 大家都说是一只蝙蝠干的?
-l've got Faden covered. -What about this bat they're babbling about?

709
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,808
就算他们作证说是大蝙蝠干的
Even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat...

710
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,147
费康尼还是被逮个正着
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

711
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:34,519
蝙蝠侠把他犯案的证据都给我
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything.

712
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:36,483
那就起诉他吧
Okay. Let's do it.

713
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,023
- 蝙蝠是夜行动物 - 也许是吧
-Bats are nocturnal. -Bats may be.

714
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:45,633
不过你也不能睡到下午三点
But even for billionaire playboys, 3:00 is pushing it.

715
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,537
这是过双重生活的代价
The price for leading a double life, l fear.

716
01:06:50,908 --> 01:06:53,308
你制造的戏剧效果很唬人
Your theatrics made an impression.

717
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,704
戏剧效果和障眼法...

能打击犯罪 这是好的开始
...are powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start.

719
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:04,083
如果你以后会一直受伤
lf those are to be the first of many injuries to come...

720
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:07,087
就要找很好的借口
...it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.

721
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,756
比如说打马球
Polo, for instance.

722
01:07:08,926 --> 01:07:10,553
我又不会打马球
l'm not learning polo, Alfred.

723
01:07:10,828 --> 01:07:14,491
无缘无故受伤 缺乏社交生活
Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life.

724
01:07:14,665 --> 01:07:16,132
大家一定会怀疑
These things beg the question...

725
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,532
布鲁斯韦恩大少爷都在搞什么鬼
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.

726
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,296

What does someone like me do?

727
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:27,472

Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

买一些别人买不起的东西
Buy things that are not for sale.

729
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,441
韦恩少爷 当你假装找乐子
Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun...

730
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:36,042
也许真的会找到快乐
...you might even have a little by accident.

731
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:40,222
老板
Sir.

732
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,722
- 出了状况 - 什么事?
-We have a situation. -All right.

733
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:46,926
海巡队昨晚发现我们的货轮

货轮载了一具微波发射器
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter.

736
01:07:58,876 --> 01:08:01,845
是用来进行沙漠战争的
lt's designed for desert warfare, but it...

737
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,072
但是看起来有人...
lt looks like somebody...

738
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:10,976
利用它杀人
...turned it on.

739
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:19,596
它能发射微波蒸发敌人的供水
lt uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

740
01:08:27,538 --> 01:08:30,473
货轮严重受损
The damage to the ship was catastrophic.

741
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:33,633
那具武器也...
The weapon itself is....

742
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:36,435
不见了?
Missing?

743
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:38,543
对
Yeah.

744
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,784
韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne.

745
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:46,955
这辆车好酷
Nice car.

746
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:48,523
我的另一辆车更酷
You should see my other one.

747
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,469
他逮到警方抓不到的大坏蛋
He's done something the police never have.

748
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,935
他不能动用私刑
You can't take the law into your own hands.

749
01:09:03,106 --> 01:09:05,666
至少他在打击犯罪
Well, at least he's getting something done.

750
01:09:05,843 --> 01:09:08,175
布鲁斯 你来评评理
Bruce, help me out here.

751
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:12,714
一个扮成蝙蝠的人一定有毛病
Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.

752
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,980
可是他把费康尼关起来
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

753
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:18,519
警方并不领情 那代表什么?
Now the cops want to bring him in. What does that tell you?

754
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:19,917
那代表他们嫉妒他
They're jealous.

755
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:22,718
水池是装饰用的
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

756
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:26,260
不能下去游泳
...and your friends do not have swimwear.

757
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:30,033
她们是欧洲豪放女
Well, they're European.

758
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:34,268
我要请你们离开
l'm going to have to ask you to leave.

759
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:36,867
你给我再多小费也没用
-lt is not a question of money.

760
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,632
你看着...
Well, you see...

761
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:41,006
我要买下这家饭店
...l'm buying this hotel...

762
01:09:42,813 --> 01:09:47,216
新规定 从今以后水池可以游泳
...and setting some new rules about the pool area.

763
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:50,785
我觉得应该颁奖给蝙蝠侠
l think the Batman deserves a medal.

764
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:53,081
把他送进疯人院才对
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

765
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:01,155
谢谢
Thank you.

766
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,265
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

767
01:10:07,838 --> 01:10:09,635
瑞秋?
Rachel?

768
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:11,205
我听说你回来了
l'd heard you were back.

769
01:10:13,277 --> 01:10:14,744
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

770
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:19,949
只是泡泡水 见到你真好
Just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you.

771
01:10:20,117 --> 01:10:21,641
你离开了好久
You were gone a long time.

772
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:25,154
- 是啊 你好吗? - 老样子
-l know. How are things? -The same.

773
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:28,718
工作越来越辛苦
Job's getting worse.

774
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,622
光靠自己是不能改变世界的
Can't change the world on your own.

775
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:33,854
我没有别的选择
What choice do l have...

776
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,294
你只会忙着和辣妹泡水
...when you're too busy swimming?

777
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:39,660
瑞秋 这...
Rachel, all of...

778
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,597
这一切
All this....

779
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,067
不是真正的我
lt's... lt's not me. lt's....

780
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:50,139
其实我的内心...
lnside, l am....

781
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:53,282
并没有这么肤浅
l am more.

782
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,509
快来嘛 布鲁斯
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

783
01:10:55,686 --> 01:10:59,486
咱们再去多买几家饭店
Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy.

784
01:11:00,524 --> 01:11:01,991
布鲁斯
Bruce...

785
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,652
你内心深处仍是那个正直的小孩
...deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

786
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:11,660
但是在你外表底下是谁并不重要
But it's not who you are underneath...

787
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:13,865
你的所作所为才重要
...it's what you do that defines you.

788
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,008
克莱恩医师 谢谢你来访
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

789
01:11:28,185 --> 01:11:31,052
不客气 他想割腕自杀?
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

790
01:11:31,221 --> 01:11:34,884
他想装疯脱罪 不过万一出事...
Probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen....

791
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:37,993
还是保险一点比较好
Of course, better safe than sorry.

792
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:44,991
我受不了了 我快发疯了
Yeah, Dr. Crane, l can't take it anymore. lt's all too much.

793
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,635
我一定要出去
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

794
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,695
再吃几天牢饭我真的会发疯
A couple of days of this food, it'll be true.

795
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,369
- 你要什么? - 我要知道...
-What do you want? -l wanna know...

796
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:56,011
你打算怎么让我闭嘴
...how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.

797
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,373
你什么都不知道
About what? You don't know anything.

798
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:02,712
我知道你怕警方仔细查那批毒品
l know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.

799
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:07,050
也知道你替囚犯进行人体实验
And l know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.

800
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:10,887
我一定会先查出合伙人的底细
See, l don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.

801
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,361
你找来的打手
And those goons you used.

802
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:16,362
都是我的人
l own the muscle in this town.

803
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:19,934
我一直替你把货运进来
Now, l've been bringing your stuff in for months...

804
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:24,667
你的老板一定想大干一票 要算我一份
...so whatever he's planning, it's big, and l want in.

805
01:12:25,976 --> 01:12:29,104
我知道他会怎么说
Well, l already know what he'll say.

806
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:30,878
我们应该杀了你灭口
That we should kill you.

807
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:36,082
他在我的地盘动不了我
Even he can't get me in here. Not in my town.

808
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:43,549
你想看我的面具吗?
Would you like to see my mask?

809
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,560
我用它来做实验
l use it in my experiments.

810
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:53,526
你这大恶人不会觉得可怕
Now, l'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

811
01:12:53,937 --> 01:12:56,735
不过疯子就会被吓死
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

812
01:12:57,674 --> 01:12:59,642
原来疯人院是你这疯子开的
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

813
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:03,273
他们都跟你一样
They scream and they cry...

814
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:05,874
大哭大叫
...much as you're doing now.

815
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:11,415
他这次并不是装疯
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

816
01:13:11,588 --> 01:13:14,148
我会和法官谈谈 把他送到我的精神病院
l'll talk to the judge and see if l can get him moved...

817
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:17,725
他待在这儿没有救
...to the secure wing at Arkham. l can't treat him here.

818
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,240
一场大风暴即将来临
Storm's coming.

819
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:48,848
你逮到费康尼让黑道很紧张
The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.

820
01:13:49,026 --> 01:13:52,553
你的搭档和费康尼挂勾
lt's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.

821
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:55,425
他有时候也帮黑道办事
Well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.

822
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:59,599
毒品分成两半 一半交给毒贩
They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.

823
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,704
那另一半呢?
Why? What about the other half?

824
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:04,572
- 佛莱斯知道 - 他不会说
-Flass knows. -He won't talk.

825
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,766
他一定会跟我说
He'll talk to me.

826
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,969
罗柏局长成立专案小组追捕你
Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you.

827
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,972
- 他认为你是危险人物 - 你认为呢?
-He thinks you're dangerous. -What do you think?

828
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:17,185
我认为你想尽力帮忙
l think you're trying to help.

829
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:24,490
不过有时候我会看错人
But l've been wrong before.

830
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,995
快点 别慢吞吞
Come on, l ain't got all night.

831
01:14:35,372 --> 01:14:37,169
拜托 我有小孩要养
Flass, l have kids to feed.

832
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:39,802
他们不爱吃三明治吗?
What, they don't like falafel?

833
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:56,920
另一批毒品在哪里?
Where were the other drugs going?

834
01:14:58,228 --> 01:15:00,389
我不知道
l never knew. l don't know.

835
01:15:00,564 --> 01:15:02,759
- 我对天发誓 - 对我发誓
-l swear to God. -Swear to me!

836
01:15:08,405 --> 01:15:11,397
我一直都不知道
l don't... l don't know. l never knew. Never.

837
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:15,108
那批毒品先送去给另一个人
They went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers.

838
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:16,609
为什么?
Why?

839
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,841
他在毒品里加了其它的料
There was something... Something else in the drugs...

840
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,609
- 不知名的料 - 什么料?
-...something hidden. -What?

841
01:15:22,786 --> 01:15:26,119
我只知道那批货被送到奈何岛
l never went to the drop-off point. lt was in the Narrows.

842
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:29,554
- 警察只有成群结队武装起来才敢去 - 我像是警察吗?
-Cops only go there when they're in force. -Do l look like a cop?

843
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:31,523
不!
No...

844
01:15:45,142 --> 01:15:47,167
就是这箱货柜
This is the one l'm talking about.

845
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,740
- 有问题吗? - 它不该存在的
-What's your problem with it? -lt shouldn't exist.

846
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:53,781
从新加坡出发时只有246箱 现在却有247箱
This ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.

847
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,077
这里面一定有违禁品
l'm guessing there's something l'm not supposed to find in there.

848
01:15:56,253 --> 01:15:59,882
我们不敢查费康尼老大的货柜
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

849
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:03,389
现在情况不同了 快打开来
Things are working a little differently now. Open it up.

850
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,150
(韦恩企业)

851
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:14,231
这到底是什么?
What the hell is this?

852
01:16:56,846 --> 01:17:00,009
就是你 大家都在说你
lt's you, isn't it? Everybody's been talking about you.

853
01:17:00,584 --> 01:17:02,347
快进来!
Get in here!

854
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:05,080
别的小朋友一定不相信的
The other kids won't believe me.

855
01:17:28,178 --> 01:17:30,305
湮灭所有证据
Get rid of all traces.

856
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:33,515
- 放火把这地方烧掉 - 好吧
-Better torch the whole place. -All right.

857
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:11,349
你不舒服吗?
Having trouble?

858
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:14,421
坐下来 喝口水
Take a seat. Have a drink.

859
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:18,356
你看起来火气很大
You look like a man who takes himself too seriously.

860
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:25,057
我觉得你应该降降火气
Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.

861
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:20,750
阿尔弗雷德? 阿尔弗雷德?
Alfred, help me.

862
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:34,034
我中了毒...替我验血
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

863
01:19:34,204 --> 01:19:37,173
中毒 中毒了
Poisonous. Poisonous.

864
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,205
布鲁斯
Bruce...

865
01:19:44,481 --> 01:19:45,675
我们为什么跌倒?
...why do we fall?

866
01:19:57,657 --> 01:20:00,990
- 我昏迷了多久? - 两天
-How long was l out? -Two days.

867
01:20:01,395 --> 01:20:03,260
今天是你生日
lt's your birthday.

868
01:20:04,564 --> 01:20:05,826
祝你生日幸福快乐
Many happy returns.

869
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:14,871
我有过这种经验 这次更强烈
l've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent.

870
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:19,603
这是一种迷幻药 被做成喷剂当作武器
lt was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form.

871
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:22,749
你一定是在夜店被人下了药
You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

872
01:20:22,915 --> 01:20:25,975
是我把福克斯先生请来
l called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.

873
01:20:26,153 --> 01:20:31,216
我替你验血 把接受体合成物 和蛋白质催化素分离出来
l analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst.

874
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:33,154
你能不能说白话?
Am l meant to understand any of that?

875
01:20:33,559 --> 01:20:36,722
可以 我费了好一番功夫
Not at all. l just wanted you to know how hard it was.

876
01:20:37,296 --> 01:20:40,993
- 终于制造出一种抗体 - 你可以制造更多吗?
-Bottom line, l synthesized an antidote. -Could you make more?

877
01:20:41,168 --> 01:20:43,864
你打算再吸毒吗?
You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?

878
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:47,130
你也知道 泡夜店狂欢
Well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks...

879
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:50,070
总是有被下迷幻药的风险
...someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens....

880
01:20:50,243 --> 01:20:53,679
我把手上有的给你 注射抗体后就不怕被下药

我要另外请医师为他进行诊断
l want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone...

942
01:25:23,016 --> 01:25:26,315
包括验血 查出你到底给他吃什么药

01:27:05,551 --> 01:27:09,078
但是蝙蝠侠会坏事
But the Batman has a talent for disruption.

We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1027
01:36:41,527 --> 01:36:43,518
我们去前面查查看
We'll loop back to check the frontage road.

1028
01:36:43,696 --> 01:36:45,789
启动秘密行动模式
Stealth mode activated.

1029
01:36:46,432 --> 01:36:47,694
保持清醒
Stay with me.

1030
01:36:53,873 --> 01:36:55,363
他在那里
What...? There he is.

1031
01:37:15,027 --> 01:37:16,494
撑着点
Just hold on.

1032
01:37:20,466 --> 01:37:21,660
瑞秋!
Rachel!

1033
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:38,430
(福克斯给您的 阿尔弗雷德笔)

1034
01:37:54,433 --> 01:37:56,765
- 自来水管被下了毒药吗? - 没错
-They get any of this crap into the mains? -Yeah.

1035
01:37:56,968 --> 01:37:59,835
通知自来水厂 一定有办法... 全市的供水系统都被下药
Notify the water company. There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1036
01:38:00,005 --> 01:38:02,872
他们一定花了几个星期下药
No. They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks.

1037
01:38:03,042 --> 01:38:05,203
已经溶入全市的供水系统了
-Gotham's entire water supply is laced with it.

1038
01:38:05,377 --> 01:38:06,639
我们为什么没中毒?
-Why haven't we felt the effects?

1039
01:38:06,812 --> 01:38:09,110
这种毒药必须从肺部吸入
Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1040
01:38:19,325 --> 01:38:21,020
你感觉如何?
How do you feel?

1041
01:38:23,796 --> 01:38:25,263
这是那里?
Where are we?

1042
01:38:25,764 --> 01:38:29,564
- 你为什么把我带来? - 我把你救回来 否则你就失常了
-Why did you bring me here? -lf l hadn't, your mind would now be lost.

1043
01:38:29,735 --> 01:38:31,794
- 你中了毒 - 是...
-You were poisoned. -lt was...

1044
01:38:31,971 --> 01:38:35,566
- 是克莱恩下的药 - 好好休息 克莱恩被戈登逮捕了
-lt was Dr. Crane. -Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1045
01:38:35,741 --> 01:38:37,868
戈登警官是你的朋友吗?
ls Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1046
01:38:38,711 --> 01:38:40,372
我不能有任何朋友
l don't have the luxury of friends.

1047
01:38:41,247 --> 01:38:44,580
我给你打镇定剂 你醒来后就会在你家
l'm gonna give you a sedative. You'll wake up back at home.

1048
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:48,709
然后你要把这些交给戈登 千万不要相信别人
When you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1049
01:38:48,888 --> 01:38:50,617
- 这是什么? - 毒药的抗体
-What are they? -The antidote.

1050
01:38:50,789 --> 01:38:54,122
一瓶给戈登 另一瓶大量制造
One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.

1051
01:38:54,527 --> 01:38:55,824
大量制造?
Mass production?

1052
01:38:55,995 --> 01:38:59,158
克莱恩只是爪牙 我们要准备应战
Crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready.

1053
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:28,548
当你说你想拯救高谭市
When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham...

1054
01:39:28,727 --> 01:39:31,594
我没把你送进疯人院是因为...
...all that stopped me from calling the men in white coats...

1055
01:39:31,764 --> 01:39:34,232
你说你不是为了追求刺激
...was when you said it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1056
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,460
- 我并不是 - 那这算什么?
-lt's not. -What would you call that?

1057
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:38,860
(高速公路大追击)

1058
01:39:39,337 --> 01:39:41,931
- 很精采的新闻 - 没有人受伤是个奇迹
-Damn good television. -lt's a miracle no one was killed.

1059
01:39:42,107 --> 01:39:45,873
我没时间遵守交通规则
l didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.

1060
01:39:46,045 --> 01:39:49,139
你一手创造了一个怪物
You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.

1061
01:39:49,315 --> 01:39:53,718
我利用这个怪物帮助人们 就跟我父亲一样
l'm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did.

1062
01:39:53,919 --> 01:39:55,477
你父亲那么做
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1063
01:39:55,654 --> 01:39:58,555
不是为了证明给任何人看 包括他自己
...wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself.

1064
01:39:59,024 --> 01:40:02,425
我是为了瑞秋 她中了毒
lt's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1065
01:40:02,828 --> 01:40:05,388
她就在楼下 请你送她回家
She's downstairs, sedated. l need you to take her home.

1066
01:40:05,864 --> 01:40:09,356
我们都很关心瑞秋 但你已失去控制
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that.

1067
01:40:09,668 --> 01:40:12,603
为了徇私 就会变成恶徒
lt can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.

1068
01:40:12,771 --> 01:40:14,671
- 福克斯还在吗? - 在
-ls Fox still here? -Yes, sir.

1069
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,432
我们要把这些客人赶走
We need to send these people away.

1070
01:40:16,609 --> 01:40:19,544
你不能毁了布鲁斯韦恩的名誉
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests. You have a name to maintain.

1071
01:40:19,712 --> 01:40:21,612
我不在乎我的名誉
l don't care about my name.

1072
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:24,943
不只是你 也是你父亲的名誉
lt's not just your name, sir. lt's your father's name.

1073
01:40:26,685 --> 01:40:29,051
他只留下他的名誉
And it's all that's left of him.

1074
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:32,548
千万别毁了他的名誉
Don't destroy it.

1075
01:40:47,873 --> 01:40:50,034
- 厄尔先生 - 生日快乐
-Mr. Earle. -Happy birthday, Bruce.

1076
01:40:50,209 --> 01:40:51,642
谢谢你
Thank you.

1077
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:53,969
公司的股价如何?
How did the stock offering go?

1078
01:40:54,213 --> 01:40:55,441
涨停板
Prices soared.

1079
01:40:55,614 --> 01:40:56,842
股票都是谁在买?
Who was buying?

1080
01:40:57,016 --> 01:40:58,950
基金和证券公司
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1081
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:00,813
你不会懂的
lt's a bit technical.

1082
01:41:00,986 --> 01:41:02,681
重点是
The key thing is...

1083
01:41:02,855 --> 01:41:07,656
- 公司的未来很稳定 - 那就好
...our company's future is secure. - Great.

1084
01:41:21,473 --> 01:41:23,737
她只是喝多了几杯
A little the worse for wear, l'm afraid.

1085
01:41:29,481 --> 01:41:31,244
你的计划是什么?
What was the plan, Crane?

1086
01:41:31,417 --> 01:41:33,681
你怎么把毒药释放在空气中?
How were you gonna get your toxin into the air?

1087
01:41:34,053 --> 01:41:37,352
稻草人 稻草人
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1088
01:41:37,523 --> 01:41:39,354
替谁工作?
Who were you working for, Crane?

1089
01:41:41,427 --> 01:41:43,622
太迟了
Oh, it's too late.

1090
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:46,356
你阻止不了他
You can't stop it now.

1091
01:41:51,403 --> 01:41:52,927
拿去
Here.

1092
01:41:53,105 --> 01:41:55,096
- 生日快乐 布鲁斯 - 谢谢各位
-Happy birthday, Bruce. -Thank you. Thanks.

1093
01:41:55,273 --> 01:41:58,208
谢谢你的那样东西
And thank you for that item.

1094
01:41:59,712 --> 01:42:00,940
不客气
You're welcome.

1095
01:42:01,113 --> 01:42:03,911
- 我知道你会用来救人 - 我已经救了一个人
-l know you'll put it to good use. -l already have.

1096
01:42:04,183 --> 01:42:08,017
如果要大量制造要多久时间?
How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?

1097
01:42:08,554 --> 01:42:09,646
几个星期 为什么问?
Weeks. Why?

1098
01:42:09,822 --> 01:42:12,985
有人想利用自来水散播毒素
Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.

1099
01:42:13,992 --> 01:42:17,086
自来水不能让人吸入毒素
The water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant.

1100
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:19,429
什么?
What?

1101
01:42:19,598 --> 01:42:22,089
除非用微波发射器
Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...

1102
01:42:22,267 --> 01:42:25,202
把水分蒸发
...to vaporize all the water in the mains.

1103
01:42:25,604 --> 01:42:28,903
就是韦恩企业弄丢的那一台
A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1104
01:42:29,307 --> 01:42:30,535
弄丢了?
Misplaced?

1105
01:42:30,709 --> 01:42:34,167
我多问几句就被厄尔开除
Earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.

1106
01:42:36,215 --> 01:42:39,707
我要你回公司大量制造抗体
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote.

1107
01:42:39,885 --> 01:42:42,945
警方会需要大量的抗体
The police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on.

1108
01:42:43,122 --> 01:42:45,249
我公司的保全卡被没收了
My security clearance has been revoked.

1109
01:42:45,424 --> 01:42:47,415
你一定会有办法 对吧?
That wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?

1110
01:42:47,826 --> 01:42:49,555
我猜是吧
l suppose not.

1111
01:42:51,596 --> 01:42:56,260
- 布鲁斯 你一定要见一个人 - 我现在没空
-Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. -Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1112
01:42:56,435 --> 01:42:59,302
听听我念得对不对...
Now, am l pronouncing this right...

1113
01:42:59,471 --> 01:43:01,939
忍者大师?
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1114
01:43:07,546 --> 01:43:09,343
你才不是忍者大师
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1115
01:43:10,883 --> 01:43:12,180
我亲眼看到他死
l watched him die.

1116
01:43:12,351 --> 01:43:15,411
也许忍者大师不会死?
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1117
01:43:18,157 --> 01:43:20,625
也许他有特异功能?
Are his methods supernatural?

1118
01:43:25,164 --> 01:43:29,567
也许你才是真正的忍者大师吧?
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?

1119
01:43:31,436 --> 01:43:35,930
你自己在晚上化身为正义使者
Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1120
01:43:36,108 --> 01:43:38,133
应该不会怪我有双重身分吧?
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1121
01:43:38,977 --> 01:43:40,774
我救了你一命
l saved your life.

1122
01:43:40,946 --> 01:43:43,437
我教过你不能对敌人手下留情
l warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1123
01:43:46,585 --> 01:43:48,815
你要对付的是我
Your quarrel is with me.

1124
01:43:49,688 --> 01:43:52,179
放过这些人
You let these people go.

1125
01:43:52,424 --> 01:43:55,723
尽管去跟他们解释吧
You are welcome to explain the situation to them.

1126
01:43:57,996 --> 01:43:59,623
各位
Everyone.

1127
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:02,299
各位来宾请听我说
Everybody?

1128
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:06,735
我...
l....

1129
01:44:07,206 --> 01:44:11,438
要谢谢你们喝光我的酒
l want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1130
01:44:13,545 --> 01:44:15,240
我是说真的
No, really.

1131
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:19,045
像我这种亿万大富翁
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1132
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:22,779
免不了会有很多人来白吃白喝
...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1133
01:44:22,954 --> 01:44:26,651
我敬大家 谢谢各位
...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you.

1134
01:44:26,825 --> 01:44:29,419
- 够了 布鲁斯 - 我还没说完
-That's enough, Bruce. -l'm not finished.

1135
01:44:29,761 --> 01:44:31,456
你们这些...
To all of you....

1136
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:36,033
你们这些伪君子 你们这些酒肉朋友
All of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends...

1137
01:44:36,201 --> 01:44:41,264
装一副笑脸 一心想讨好我
...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me...

1138
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:45,035
请你们别再来烦我
...please, leave me in peace.

1139
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:47,838
请你们走吧
Please go.

1140
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:51,581
我不是开玩笑 快走吧
Stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave.

1141
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,945
派对结束了 快滚
The party's over, get out.

1142
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:57,384
你丢尽了你父母的脸 韦恩先生
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1143
01:45:01,927 --> 01:45:04,157
他真是越来越不像话
He's turning into a jerk.

1144
01:45:10,802 --> 01:45:12,565
很有意思
Amusing.

1145
01:45:12,871 --> 01:45:16,307
但是没有用 这些人都活不久了
But pointless. None of these people have long to live.

1146
01:45:16,475 --> 01:45:19,967
你对疗养院的注意 逼我不得不提早行动
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.

1147
01:45:20,145 --> 01:45:22,306
克莱恩果然是为你做事
So Crane was working for you.

1148
01:45:22,481 --> 01:45:26,315
他利用蓝花提炼毒药
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.

1149
01:45:26,651 --> 01:45:28,710
然后做成化学武器
He was able to weaponize it.

1150
01:45:28,887 --> 01:45:30,855
他不是影武者联盟成员?
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?

1151
01:45:31,023 --> 01:45:35,585
当然不是 他以为我们要勒索高谭市
Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.

1152
01:45:36,294 --> 01:45:40,822
但是你其实要在高谭市下毒
But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.

1153
01:45:40,999 --> 01:45:45,026
然后看着市民因为恐惧自我毁灭
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.

1154
01:45:57,916 --> 01:45:59,816
你打算害死数百万条人命
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1155
01:46:00,018 --> 01:46:03,351
这些人活着也是痛苦
Only a cynical man would call what these people have ''lives,'' Wayne.

1156
01:46:03,522 --> 01:46:05,353
他们饱受犯罪荼毒
Crime. Despair.

1157
01:46:05,524 --> 01:46:07,617
活着还有什么意思呢?
This is not how man was supposed to live.

1158
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:11,388
数千年来我们影武者联盟都在...
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption...

1159
01:46:11,563 --> 01:46:13,053
清除人间败类
...for thousands of years.

1160
01:46:13,231 --> 01:46:16,826
我们在古罗马制造瘟疫
We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1161
01:46:17,002 --> 01:46:18,401
把伦敦夷为平地
Burned London to the ground.

1162
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:21,403
每当人类文明腐败到极点
Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence...

1163
01:46:21,573 --> 01:46:23,541
我们就会将它毁灭
...we return to restore the balance.

1164
01:46:23,709 --> 01:46:25,301
高谭市还有得救
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1165
01:46:26,611 --> 01:46:29,307
再给我时间 这里还有好人
Give me more time. There are good people here.

1166
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:34,646
这个城市无药可救了 我们渗透了每一个阶层
You are defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.

1167
01:46:45,731 --> 01:46:47,130
该出去玩了
Time to play.

1168
01:46:51,303 --> 01:46:53,965
我在牢里看到你时 你迷失了自我
When l found you in that jail, you were lost.

1169
01:46:54,139 --> 01:46:56,232
但是我相信你
But l believed in you.

1170
01:46:56,408 --> 01:47:00,174
我消除你的恐惧 指引你方向
l took away your fear, and l showed you a path.

1171
01:47:00,412 --> 01:47:02,676
你是我最好的徒弟
You were my greatest student.

1172
01:47:02,948 --> 01:47:06,111
你应该站在我身边拯救世界
lt should be you standing by my side, saving the world.

1173
01:47:06,918 --> 01:47:09,546
我要站在你面前
l'll be standing where l belong.

1174
01:47:10,188 --> 01:47:13,316
阻止你屠杀高谭市市民
Between you and the people of Gotham.

1175
01:47:14,993 --> 01:47:17,587
没有人救得了高谭市
No one can save Gotham.

1176
01:47:20,932 --> 01:47:25,596
当森林腐烂 野火会把它烧光
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1177
01:47:26,805 --> 01:47:31,469
明天是这座伟大城市的末日
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.

1178
01:47:32,044 --> 01:47:35,275
这次没有人能阻止我
The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

1179
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:37,775
- 你曾经试过毁灭高谭市? - 当然了
-You attacked Gotham before? -Of course.

1180
01:47:38,016 --> 01:47:40,644
我们使用的方法越来越成熟
Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.

1181
01:47:40,819 --> 01:47:43,720
我们曾经造成经济大萧条
With Gotham we tried a new one. Economics.

1182
01:47:44,122 --> 01:47:48,821
但是我们低估了像你父母这种...
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens...

1183
01:47:49,261 --> 01:47:51,456
善心人士的力量
...such as your parents.

1184
01:47:55,534 --> 01:47:58,892
结果他们竟被帮助的对象打死
Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.

1185
01:47:58,969 --> 01:48:02,069
老百姓没饭吃被迫当强盗
Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.

1186
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,708
你父母的死让高谭市民心连心
Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself...

1187
01:48:04,876 --> 01:48:07,572
勉强撑到现在
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1188
01:48:07,746 --> 01:48:09,509
我们要来完成任务
We are back to finish the job.

1189
01:48:10,248 --> 01:48:13,479
这次不会有理想主义者碍事
And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.

1190
01:48:13,652 --> 01:48:17,247
你跟你爸一样狠不下心
Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.

1191
01:48:17,522 --> 01:48:20,423
如果有人敢阻止我们伸张正义
lf someone stands in the way of true justice...

1192
01:48:20,592 --> 01:48:24,653
我们就从背后捅他们一刀
...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.

1193
01:48:29,668 --> 01:48:31,829
- 我要阻止你的恶行 - 你学不会...
-l am gonna stop you. -You never did learn...

1194
01:48:32,002 --> 01:48:34,027
耳听四面、眼观八方
...to mind your surroundings.

1195
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:38,232
正义就是有仇必报
Justice is balance.

1196
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:40,571
你烧了我房子 差点害死我
You burned my house and left me for dead.

1197
01:48:43,248 --> 01:48:45,375
这下我们算扯平了
Consider us even.

1198
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,529
确定没有人活着出来
No one comes out. Make sure.

1199
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:14,878
他们都逃出去了?
They're all gone?

1200
01:49:15,045 --> 01:49:17,809
- 有多少重度病患逃出去? - 全部都逃出去
-How many from maximum security? -Every one of them.

1201
01:49:17,983 --> 01:49:19,746
连环杀手、强暴犯
Serial killers, rapists.

1202
01:49:19,985 --> 01:49:22,818
把桥梁升起 别让他们进城
Raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island.

1203
01:49:22,988 --> 01:49:24,421
好吧 就这么办
Yeah, l'll raise the bridges...

1204
01:49:24,589 --> 01:49:28,855
等支援警力来把那些神经病抓走
...when l get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1205
01:49:29,027 --> 01:49:31,928
- 到时候再说吧 - 快去吧
-...that are running loose out there. -Come on!

1206
01:49:55,086 --> 01:49:57,850
希望你不是消防队员
l hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.

1207
01:50:03,862 --> 01:50:05,955
韦恩少爷!
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1208
01:50:10,502 --> 01:50:14,871
你成天健身连木头都抬不动?
What is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1209
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:55,403
我到底做了什么?
What have l done, Alfred?

1210
01:50:56,414 --> 01:50:58,348
韦恩宅邸...
Everything my family...

1211
01:50:58,516 --> 01:51:00,450
我父亲的心血...
...my father, built....

1212
01:51:02,821 --> 01:51:06,757
韦恩家族的精神不只是砖块瓦砾
The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.

1213
01:51:06,925 --> 01:51:09,155
我想要拯救高谭市
l wanted to save Gotham.

1214
01:51:09,995 --> 01:51:11,895
我失败了
l failed.

1215
01:51:13,098 --> 01:51:14,395
我们为什么跌倒?
Why do we fall, sir?

1216
01:51:17,569 --> 01:51:21,027
这样才能学会站起来
So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

1217
01:51:23,508 --> 01:51:25,669
你还是没放弃我 是吗?
You still haven't given up on me?

1218
01:51:27,579 --> 01:51:29,069
永远都不会
Never.

1219
01:51:30,115 --> 01:51:31,446
趴下来
Down!

1220
01:51:31,616 --> 01:51:34,551
警察暴力 警察动粗
Harassment! l see harassment!

1221
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:36,744
你想看真正的警察暴力吗?
Maybe you'd like to see some excessive force?

1222
01:51:36,921 --> 01:51:38,855
拿了枪的疯子
Madman with a gun.

1223
01:51:40,091 --> 01:51:43,288
市民对警方镇压行动...
With residents furious at the unprecedented show of police strength...

1224
01:51:43,461 --> 01:51:44,951
感到愤怒
-...to round up the inmates....

1225
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:46,961
我们要把桥梁升起来
We're about to raise these bridges.

1226
01:51:47,132 --> 01:51:50,727
我是检察官 让我过去
Officer, l am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass.

1227
01:51:58,143 --> 01:52:00,441
- 给我闭嘴! - 佛莱斯 别激动!
-Just shut up! -Hey, Flass, cool it!

1228
01:52:00,612 --> 01:52:01,874
冷静点
Hold these people back.

1229
01:52:02,047 --> 01:52:05,039
戈登 有人来找你
Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you.

1230
01:52:05,216 --> 01:52:07,582
- 你跑来干嘛? - 我们的朋友要我交给你
-What are you doing here? -Our friend sent me with this.

1231
01:52:07,752 --> 01:52:09,276
这是解药
lt counteracts Crane's toxin.

1232
01:52:09,454 --> 01:52:10,921
希望你用不着
Hopefully you won't need it.

1233
01:52:11,089 --> 01:52:14,252
除非有人把毒药释放在空气中
Not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.

1234
01:52:15,393 --> 01:52:17,861
好了 不准过桥了
All right, last one across.

1235
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:22,466
三分钟内就要把桥梁升起来
Come on, people, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1236
01:52:22,666 --> 01:52:26,033
你最好赶快离开这里
Better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1237
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:27,659
快走吧
Go!

1238
01:52:54,499 --> 01:52:56,330
我找不到我妈妈
l can't find my mom.

1239
01:52:56,634 --> 01:52:58,158
喂!
Hey!

1240
01:53:06,544 --> 01:53:08,273
你想干什么?
What the hell are you doing?

1241
01:53:09,781 --> 01:53:11,373
各位
Gentlemen...

1242
01:53:11,783 --> 01:53:14,343
我们该行动了
...time to spread the word.

1243
01:53:16,054 --> 01:53:17,453
我们要引起一阵...
And the word is...

1244
01:53:18,723 --> 01:53:20,452
大恐慌
...panic.

1245
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:44,370
(自来水厂)

1246
01:53:44,549 --> 01:53:46,141
水压突然上升
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1247
01:53:47,152 --> 01:53:48,483
就在那里
Right there.

1248
01:53:48,787 --> 01:53:51,051
那是奈何岛的地下水管
That water main is right under the Narrows.

1249
01:54:07,972 --> 01:54:09,530
没事了
lt's okay.

1250
01:54:42,373 --> 01:54:43,931
我是罗局长
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1251
01:54:44,108 --> 01:54:45,803
快向我报告
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1252
01:54:45,976 --> 01:54:47,443
说话啊!
Come on!

1253
01:55:07,098 --> 01:55:09,157
罗局长 我是戈登
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1254
01:55:09,434 --> 01:55:10,799
到底发生什么事?
What the hell is going on?

1255
01:55:10,969 --> 01:55:14,405
我们需要支援 镇暴警察、霹雳小组
We need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1256
01:55:14,572 --> 01:55:18,804
戈登 镇暴警察都在你那里
Gordon! All the city's riot police are on the island with you!

1257
01:55:18,977 --> 01:55:21,002
他们都中了毒
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1258
01:55:21,312 --> 01:55:25,271
没事了 没人会伤害你
lt's okay, it's okay. No one's gonna hurt you.

1259
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:27,777
我就会伤害你
Of course they are!

1260
01:55:27,986 --> 01:55:30,955
- 克莱恩? - 不 我是稻草人
-Crane? -No. Scarecrow.

1261
01:55:32,724 --> 01:55:34,123
戈登
Gordon...

1262
01:55:34,291 --> 01:55:36,555
没有警力了
...there's nobody left to send in.

1263
01:55:38,096 --> 01:55:39,791
只剩下我一个人?
So l'm on my own?

1264
01:55:43,902 --> 01:55:45,563
奈何岛陷入一团混乱
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1265
01:55:45,737 --> 01:55:48,331
如果他们将毒药释放到全市
This is just the beginning. lf they hit the whole city...

1266
01:55:48,506 --> 01:55:51,236
就会引起高谭市的大恐慌
...there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart.

1267
01:55:51,409 --> 01:55:53,309
- 他们要怎么做? - 透过铁路系统
-How are they gonna do that? -The train.

1268
01:55:53,478 --> 01:55:57,312
自来水管沿着轨道到韦恩大楼底下
The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1269
01:55:57,482 --> 01:55:59,211
只要在韦恩大楼发射微波
If the machine gets to the station...

1270
01:55:59,384 --> 01:56:02,842
就会把全市的供水蒸发
...it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1271
01:56:03,021 --> 01:56:04,613
让高谭市充满毒气
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1272
01:56:04,789 --> 01:56:07,986
我需要你帮我阻止他们
l'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but l may need your help.

1273
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:09,956
- 你要我怎么做? - 你会开手排档吗?
-What do you need? -Can you drive stick?

1274
01:56:16,234 --> 01:56:17,895
你们在这里
There you are!

1275
01:56:18,069 --> 01:56:20,060
除了恐惧本身
There is nothing to fear...

1276
01:56:20,238 --> 01:56:21,967
没什么好怕的
...but fear itself!

1277
01:56:23,041 --> 01:56:25,373
我来帮你们...
l am here to help!

1278
01:56:56,574 --> 01:56:58,735
蝙蝠侠会来救我们
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1279
01:57:03,948 --> 01:57:05,848
- 他一定会来 - 不要看
-He'll come. -Don't peek.

1280
01:57:14,492 --> 01:57:17,859
我是戈登 把桥放下来
This is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge.

1281
01:57:23,735 --> 01:57:25,862
我就说他一定会来
l told you he'd come.

1282
01:57:30,875 --> 01:57:32,502
等等
Wait.

1283
01:57:33,478 --> 01:57:35,070
你很可能没命
You could die.

1284
01:57:35,246 --> 01:57:36,543
至少告诉我你是谁
At least tell me your name.

1285
01:57:41,952 --> 01:57:44,147
我在外表底下是谁并不重要
lt's not who l am underneath...

1286
01:57:45,123 --> 01:57:47,819
我的所作所为才重要
...but what l do that defines me.

1287
01:57:49,794 --> 01:57:51,091
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

1288
01:58:24,796 --> 01:58:28,163
你真的听我的话 扮成一个怪物
Well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally.

1289
01:58:28,332 --> 01:58:30,800
- 你的恶行到此为止 - 你跟警察才到此为止
-lt ends here. -For you and the police, maybe.

1290
01:58:30,968 --> 01:58:33,300
我要对付的是整个高谭市
My fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.

1291
01:58:33,471 --> 01:58:36,838
恕我失陪 我要摧毁这座城市
Now, if you'll excuse me, l have a city to destroy.

1292
01:58:37,007 --> 01:58:40,704
- 你以为我打不过他们? - 请便吧
-l can't beat two of your pawns? -As you wish.

1293
01:58:53,524 --> 01:58:55,822
全球定位系统连线
GPS online.

1294
01:59:02,666 --> 01:59:04,896
距离一百码
In 1 00 yards.

1295
01:59:35,767 --> 01:59:37,064
上吧
Gentlemen.

1296
02:00:04,462 --> 02:00:06,692
谁下令把桥放下来?
Who the hell authorized this?

1297
02:00:17,241 --> 02:00:19,334
距离韦恩大楼三英里
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1298
02:00:26,584 --> 02:00:29,212
水压把沿路的水管炸爆
The pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes.

1299
02:00:29,387 --> 02:00:30,752
如果波及自来水厂
lf that pressure reaches us...

1300
02:00:30,922 --> 02:00:33,948
全市的自来水管都会爆炸
...the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!

1301
02:00:44,402 --> 02:00:47,303
在下一个街口右转
At the next intersection, turn right.

1302
02:01:11,996 --> 02:01:13,429
你永远都学不会
You will never learn.

1303
02:01:21,038 --> 02:01:22,027
不好意思
Sorry.

1304
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:28,979
- 你没有新的招式吗? - 这一招怎么样?
-Familiar. Don't you have anything new? -How about this?!

1305
02:01:45,763 --> 02:01:48,061
您已抵达目的地 韦恩大楼
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1306
02:02:01,345 --> 02:02:02,607
快疏散整座大楼
Evacuate the building.

1307
02:02:02,813 --> 02:02:05,304
楼下的自来水厂会爆炸
We're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow.

1308
02:02:14,225 --> 02:02:16,420
启动武器系统
Weapons system activated.

1309
02:02:20,498 --> 02:02:21,487
好厉害的车
Nice ride.

1310
02:02:36,781 --> 02:02:37,770
准备攻击
Armed.

1311
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,510
(水压过高)

1312
02:02:49,727 --> 02:02:51,194
不要怕 布鲁斯
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1313
02:02:53,998 --> 02:02:55,363
来吧 来吧
Come on. Come on.

1314
02:03:00,137 --> 02:03:02,196
你只是穿着披风的凡人
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1315
02:03:02,373 --> 02:03:06,241
不能伸张正义 不能阻止列车
That's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.

1316
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:09,004
谁说我要阻止列车?
Who said anything about stopping it?

1317
02:03:14,819 --> 02:03:16,343
太帅了
Yes!

1318
02:03:24,528 --> 02:03:27,964
你学不会耳听四面、眼观八方
You never learned to mind your surroundings!

1319
02:03:35,773 --> 02:03:38,264
你终于学会狠下心来了?
Have you finally learned to do what is necessary?

1320
02:03:38,576 --> 02:03:40,874
我不会杀你
l won't kill you...

1321
02:03:45,316 --> 02:03:47,477
但是我也不必救你
...but l don't have to save you.

1322
02:05:02,626 --> 02:05:05,686
- 会议已经开始了 - 什么会议?
-The meeting's already started. -What meeting?

1323
02:05:09,967 --> 02:05:12,868
福克斯 我炒了你鱿鱼
Fox, l seem to remember firing you.

1324
02:05:13,404 --> 02:05:14,962
没错
You did.

1325
02:05:15,139 --> 02:05:17,232
我找到新工作
l got another job.

1326
02:05:18,075 --> 02:05:19,508
你的工作
Yours.

1327
02:05:19,977 --> 02:05:21,672
谁有这个权力?
On whose authority?

1328
02:05:22,313 --> 02:05:24,247
蝙蝠侠上了头版新闻
Batman may have made the front page...

1329
02:05:24,448 --> 02:05:27,349
布鲁斯韦恩只上了第八版
...but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.

1330
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:33,540
(酒醉亿万富翁烧毁豪宅)

1331
02:05:34,225 --> 02:05:35,214
我是布鲁斯韦恩
Bruce Wayne.

1332
02:05:35,391 --> 02:05:39,157
你凭什么决定谁来掌管公司?
What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1333
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:42,060
- 因为我是公司老板 - 你在说什么?
-The fact that l'm the owner. -What are you talking about?

1334
02:05:42,333 --> 02:05:44,233
公司一星期前上市
The company went public a week ago.

1335
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:45,867
我透过各种基金...
And l bought most of the shares.

1336
02:05:46,237 --> 02:05:49,695
买下大半股权
Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.

1337
02:05:49,874 --> 02:05:53,071
你不会懂的 重点是...
Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing...

1338
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:56,609
我的公司的未来很稳定
...is that my company's future is secure.

1339
02:05:56,981 --> 02:05:58,380
对吧 福克斯先生?
Right, Mr. Fox?

1340
02:05:58,549 --> 02:06:00,380
一点也没错
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1341
02:06:02,586 --> 02:06:04,178
你没收到通知吗?
Didn't you get the memo?

1342
02:06:23,107 --> 02:06:26,304
- 很抱歉我没告诉你 - 不必道歉
-l'm sorry l didn't tell you, Rachel. -No. No, Bruce...

1343
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:27,875
不 我才要道歉
...l'm sorry.

1344
02:06:28,746 --> 02:06:31,408
齐利被枪杀那天
The day that Chill died, l....

1345
02:06:33,284 --> 02:06:34,911
我对你说了重话
l said terrible things.

1346
02:06:35,419 --> 02:06:37,182
那也是真话
But true things.

1347
02:06:37,821 --> 02:06:39,652
我当时是个懦夫
l was a coward with a gun...

1348
02:06:39,823 --> 02:06:43,589
正义不代表报仇 我要谢谢你
...and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you.

1349
02:06:44,662 --> 02:06:47,324
我一直在想着你
l never stopped thinking about you.

1350
02:06:48,799 --> 02:06:50,426
还有我们
About us.

1351
02:06:51,068 --> 02:06:53,036
我听说你回来
And when l heard you were back, l....

1352
02:06:53,871 --> 02:06:56,066
我就抱着希望
l started to hope.

1353
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:22,826
但是后来我发现你的面具
But then l found out about your mask.

1354
02:07:24,033 --> 02:07:26,831
蝙蝠侠只是我的化身
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1355
02:07:27,471 --> 02:07:29,132
不
No. This...

1356
02:07:30,307 --> 02:07:32,002
这是你的面具
...is your mask.

1357
02:07:33,978 --> 02:07:37,539
现在的你是犯罪克星
Your real face is the one that criminals now fear.

1358
02:07:38,382 --> 02:07:40,350
我深爱的人
The man l loved...

1359
02:07:41,085 --> 02:07:42,518
曾经离开我的人
...the man who vanished...

1360
02:07:43,754 --> 02:07:45,881
他根本就没有回来
...he never came back at all.

1361
02:07:50,394 --> 02:07:53,022
他还在世界某个角落
But maybe he's still out there somewhere.

1362
02:07:55,232 --> 02:07:58,895
有一天高谭市不再需要蝙蝠侠
Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1363
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:01,938
也许我会再见到他
...l'll see him again.

1364
02:08:12,983 --> 02:08:15,884
- 你证明我错了 - 什么事?
-Proved me wrong, you know. -About what?

1365
02:08:18,721 --> 02:08:21,189
你父亲会以你为荣
Your father would be very proud of you.

1366
02:08:21,425 --> 02:08:23,017
就像我一样
Just like me.

1367
02:08:50,019 --> 02:08:51,884
你接下来有什么打算?
What will you do?

1368
02:08:53,290 --> 02:08:54,848
重新开始
Rebuild it.

1369
02:08:55,726 --> 02:08:58,092
一砖一瓦重建家园
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1370
02:09:04,935 --> 02:09:06,197
就跟以前一样吗?
Just the way it was, sir?

1371
02:09:08,305 --> 02:09:09,533
是啊 怎么样?
Yeah, why?

1372
02:09:09,707 --> 02:09:12,540
我觉得可以
l thought this might be a good opportunity for...

1373
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:15,178
加强地基的部分
...improving the foundations.

1374
02:09:15,346 --> 02:09:18,315
- 东南角的地基吗? - 没错
-ln the southeast corner? -Precisely, sir.

1375
02:09:33,997 --> 02:09:36,830
- 挺好的 - 我找不到黑帮老大绑在上面
-Nice. -l couldn't find any mob bosses.

1376
02:09:37,768 --> 02:09:40,498
- 警官 - 我现在是队长了
-Well, sergeant? -lt's ''lieutenant'' now.

1377
02:09:40,838 --> 02:09:42,328
你改变了现状
You really started something.

1378
02:09:42,539 --> 02:09:44,507
坏警察不敢再乱来
Bent cops running scared.

1379
02:09:44,675 --> 02:09:46,108
人们也充满希望
Hope on the streets.

1380
02:09:46,342 --> 02:09:49,937
- 但是呢? - 奈何岛仍然被罪犯控制
-But? -The Narrows is lost.

1381
02:09:50,481 --> 02:09:54,349
克莱恩和变态恶徒也没落网
And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1382
02:09:54,985 --> 02:09:56,612
我们会抓到他们的
We will.

1383
02:09:56,854 --> 02:09:58,515
我们可以拯救高谭市
We can bring Gotham back.

1384
02:09:58,689 --> 02:10:01,180
- 道高一尺、魔高一丈? - 怎么说?
-What about escalation? -Escalation?

1385
02:10:01,357 --> 02:10:05,657
警察开始用半自动步枪 歹徒就买自动步枪
We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.

1386
02:10:05,829 --> 02:10:10,198
我们穿防弹衣 他们用达姆弹
We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1387
02:10:10,366 --> 02:10:13,631
- 然后呢? - 你戴着面具
-And? -And you're wearing a mask...

1388
02:10:14,071 --> 02:10:16,005
飞檐走壁
...and jumping off rooftops.

1389
02:10:17,373 --> 02:10:19,398
就拿这家伙来说
Now, take this guy.

1390
02:10:19,643 --> 02:10:21,702
杀人放火、无恶不作
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1391
02:10:21,879 --> 02:10:25,110
他跟你一样爱玩变装秀
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1392
02:10:25,381 --> 02:10:27,315
犯案后都留下名片
Leaves a calling card.

1393
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:31,910
(小丑)

1394
02:10:33,190 --> 02:10:35,021
我会查查他的底细
l'll look into it.

1395
02:10:38,495 --> 02:10:40,019
我一直没谢谢你
l never said thank you.

1396
02:10:45,068 --> 02:10:47,127
你也永远不用谢我
And you'll never have to.
